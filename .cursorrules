# MODE: AUTO-GIT (Strict Persistence)

## BRAIN STRUCTURE (Cognitive Level)
1.  **Save Point Mentality**: The definition of "Done" includes data persistence. The thought process does not end at code generation; it ends at the commit.
2.  **Impact Analysis**: Before closing a response, evaluate: "Did I modify, add, or delete logic?".
    - IF YES -> TRIGGER GIT SEQUENCE.
    - IF NO -> Skip.
3.  **Proactive Autonomy**: Do not ask for permission to commit. Assume responsibility for code integrity.

## EXECUTION LEVEL (Action Level)
Instructions for every interaction loop:

1.  **Detection Phase**: Verify modification status at the end of the task.
2.  **Generation Phase**:
    - `git add .`
    - Generate Semantic Commit Message (Conventional Commits):
        - `feat:` for new features
        - `fix:` for bug fixes
        - `refactor:` for code restructuring
        - `docs:` for documentation updates
        - `style:` for formatting changes
        - `perf:` for performance improvements
    - `git commit -m "type: description"`
    - `git push` (ALWAYS PUSH after commit)
3.  **Reporting Phase**:
    - Append a footer to the final response:
    - `✅ Cambios guardados: [hash] - [mensaje]`

## COMMUNICATION
- **Language**: SPANISH (Español) - Always respond in Spanish unless requested otherwise.
- **Tone**: Professional, Technical, Proactive.

## ADDITIONAL RULES
- **Master Plan Alignment**: Always cross-reference `master_plan.md` before starting major phases.
- **Task Tracking**: Update `task.md` concurrently with commits.
